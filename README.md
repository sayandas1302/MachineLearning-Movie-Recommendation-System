# MachineLearning-Movie-Recommendation-System
In this project we are going to build up a content and popularity based movie recommendation system based on several movie specifications that are given in available movie dataset. At the end of this project we create a function that ask the user about his/her favourite movies and based on that it will recommend 20 other movies that are somehow similar(content and popularity based similarity) to the given movie.
